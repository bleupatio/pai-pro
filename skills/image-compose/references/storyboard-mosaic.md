# NxN storyboard mosaic — prompt template

Bracketed-section format for `node "$PAI_REPO_ROOT/server/cli/generate_image_pro.js"` (the pro image tier). Produces ONE composite image of N×M storyboard panels on a single sheet, with per-cell number badges so downstream video-compose can read panel order. Default to exact `--size 2560x1440`.

## Pre-flight: current canvas state

This flow needs the current canvas, so per the project `PROJECT_AGENT.md` § "Choosing context", read `./workflow.json` and identify:

- script note (`data.subtype === "script"`; fall back to label starting `"Script:"` for legacy notes)
- shot notes (`data.subtype === "shot"`; fall back to label matching `"Shot <N> (<a>–<b>s)"` for legacy notes)
- location nodes (`image_result` with `data.subtype = "location"`)
- character nodes (`image_result` with `data.subtype = "character"`)

Decide how many mosaics to emit:

- **Shot notes exist.** Emit ONE mosaic PER SHOT NOTE. Each shot note already represents one planned clip capped at <=15s. For each mosaic: pass `--source-node-id <shot_note_id>`, refs = `[location.id if the shot has one, ...each character.id appearing in the shot]` capped at 32, and `[SCRIPT SLICE]` = that one shot note body verbatim.
- **No shot notes, but one <=15s script/story/clip brief exists.** Behave as a single planned clip: ONE 2×2 mosaic. Pass `--source-node-id <script_note_id>` if the brief is a canvas note. Refs are optional — pass any relevant characters / locations / user-uploaded images on the canvas via repeated `--ref-source-id` flags for identity lock.
- **No shot notes and the script/story is longer than <=15s.** Recommend `script-compose` splitting first. Do not collapse a multi-clip script into one storyboard unless the user explicitly asks for an overview board.

Missing character/location anchors do not change the storyboard unit. If a shot clearly needs a missing anchor, say so and ask whether to make that anchor first or storyboard from text directly.

Default grid: 2×2 unless the user specified otherwise. Before each `generate_image_pro.js` call, announce in chat: `"Generating a 2×2 mosaic for Shot <N>"` (shot-note case) or `"Generating a 2×2 mosaic."` (single-clip case). Don't paste the prompt; one short line.

## Per-shot-note iteration

If the canvas has N shot notes, fill the prompt template N times — once per shot note — and call `generate_image_pro.js` N times. Don't combine multiple shot notes into one storyboard unless the user asks for an overview board.

## Prompt template (use verbatim, fill the bracketed parts)

```
[STYLE]
[paste one preset block from "Style presets" below — verbatim]

[GRID LAYOUT]
[N]×[M] cells, identical size, separated by thin solid pure opaque BLACK gutters (#000000) between every adjacent cell — horizontally and vertically — and a thin black border around the outer edge of the sheet. Each cell is composed in 16:9 cinematic landscape inside its own bounds. Gutters are thin but clearly visible — like the gap between postage stamps. Each cell fills its space edge-to-edge with the rendered shot, stopping cleanly at the gutter.

[CELL ORDER]
Numbered LEFT-TO-RIGHT, ROW BY ROW: cell 1 = top-left, cell 2 = next-right, …, cell [N×M] = bottom-right.

[PER CELL]
- TOP-LEFT CORNER: a small bold white-on-black number badge showing the cell's panel number (1, 2, 3 …). Roughly 6% of the cell's height. Sans-serif. Placed INSIDE the cell, flush against the top and left gutters, with a few pixels of inset. The badge sits cleanly on top of the rendered shot — no transparency, no glow, no drop shadow.
- CENTER / REMAINDER: the shot rendered per [PANEL LIST] below.
- The number badge is the ONLY text anywhere inside the cell.

[CHARACTER]
The same character(s) appear consistently across every panel where they appear — same face, same build, same age, same wardrobe, same hair, same accurate proportions. [If refs provided] every detail of identity matches the attached reference images. Identity does not drift between cells.

[SCRIPT SLICE]
[Only when a shot/script note feeds this mosaic — paste that one note body verbatim. The panels visualize this verbatim slice; do not paraphrase, do not embellish.]

[SHOT]
[paste the user's scene description verbatim]

[PANEL LIST]
Panel 1 — [framing / beat]
Panel 2 — [framing / beat]
...
Panel [N×M] — [framing / final beat]

[CONTINUITY]
Same wardrobe, same props, same locations across all panels. Same lighting state across every cell — same sun position or key-light direction, same ambient color, same time of day. Same color palette and grading across cells. The style chosen in [STYLE] is locked for every cell — never mix photoreal with sketch. [If a location ref is passed] Same location across all panels — the location matches the attached @Image1 reference exactly.

[NEGATIVE]
No captions, subtitles, panel titles, dialogue text, or any text inside cells other than the corner number badge. No watermarks, logos, or signatures. Gutters are solid pure opaque black — no gradient, no texture, no line art, no labels, no numbering in the gutter. All cells are the same size — no varying frame proportions. No camera/director annotations. No motion arrows or directional overlays unless requested.
```

## Style presets

Pick ONE and paste verbatim into `[STYLE]`. Don't combine. Each preset gives the model concrete render cues, not abstract labels.

**Photoreal cinematic**
```
Photoreal cinematic still. Shot on a full-frame digital cinema camera, fast prime lens, shallow depth of field. Soft key light with ambient fill. Restrained naturalistic color palette. Subtle film grain. Anamorphic feel. No HDR oversaturation, no over-sharpening.
```

**Pencil-and-ink storyboard**
```
Hand-drawn storyboard style. Graphite pencil with black ink wash on cream paper. Loose gestural linework, visible construction lines, minimal value shading. Slight paper grain visible across the sheet. Monochrome or near-monochrome — no full color. Hand-drawn feel, not vector-clean.
```

**Painted concept art**
```
Digital painted concept-art finish. Soft brushwork, atmospheric perspective, painterly edges (not photographic). Restrained palette of 3–5 hues. Visible brush direction in skies and surfaces. Cinematic but illustrative, never photorealistic.
```

## Default per-panel coverage when the user didn't specify

If the user gave a scene description but no per-panel breakdown, propose cinematic shot coverage — wide, medium, close-up, end beat. A 2×2 default coverage:

1. WIDE ESTABLISHING
2. CLOSE-UP on subject's face
3. REACTION / CUT-AWAY to secondary character or environment
4. END BEAT (subject moving toward / away from frame)

Use the user's scene description to fill in the action for each. Don't ask the user to specify all N×M panels themselves unless they explicitly asked for input control.
