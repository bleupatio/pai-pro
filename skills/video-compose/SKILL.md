name: video-compose
description: Generates and prompts video clips on the filmmaking canvas. Use when the user asks to generate, render, animate, continue, restyle, edit, shoot, or compose a video clip; render script or shot notes as video; animate a storyboard, starting frame, image, character, location, or reference; use image, video, audio, storyboard, starting-frame, or voice refs; compose an ad, brand film, product promo, music-video shot, or video sequence; or before calling generate_video.js. Owns video CLI flags, refs, prompt construction, audio-ref handling, and video failure recovery.

This file is the intent dispatcher. Each pattern below names triggers, the CLI invocation, edge / node rules, and which reference owns the prompt construction. References live in `references/`.

## Hard defaults

Behaviors that production-judgment instinct will silently flip when they aren't enshrined here. Don't override these without the user explicitly asking.

- **STAGE BY DEFAULT** — every `generate_video.js` call goes through `--stage`; the command waits until the user fires or cancels the draft from the canvas, then prints the terminal result as its final JSON line.
- **AUDIO ON BY DEFAULT** — every `generate_video.js` call generates an audio track (`generate_audio: true`). Pass `--no-audio` ONLY when the user has explicitly asked for a silent clip ("silent", "no audio", "I'll add sound in post"). Trailer / portrait / cinematic framing is NOT a trigger; audio is the baseline, not optional polish.

## CLI shape

```
node "$PAI_REPO_ROOT/server/cli/generate_video.js" --prompt "..." [--duration 15] [--aspect-ratio 16:9]
  [--resolution 1080p] [--no-audio]
  [--label "..."] [--ref-source-id <id> ...] [--ref-audio-source-id <audio_id> ...]
  [--source-node-id <id>] [--shot-id <N>]
```

`$PAI_REPO_ROOT` is exported by the viewer — see the project `PROJECT_AGENT.md` § "Media CLIs / Invocation path".

Calls go via `--stage` — see the project `PROJECT_AGENT.md` § "Draft gate".

`--label` defaults to the truncated prompt (≤30 chars) if omitted. Pass
`--ref-source-id <id>` once per `image_result` / `video_result` source
node you want as a byte ref — the CLI resolves each source's
`local_path`, hands the tunnel URL to PAI's `video-generation-assets`
endpoint, and emits one `derived` edge per ref. Pass
`--ref-audio-source-id <audio_id>` once per canvas `audio_result` node
you want as an audio ref (same wiring; separate flag so the CLI can
partition by type without reading the workflow). External URLs (a
pasted CDN link, a still you want as a ref) must be mirrored onto the
canvas first via `mirror_url.js --url <URL>` — the returned
`node_id` plugs into `--ref-source-id` like any other canvas source.
When a canvas note authored the clip (most commonly a shot note being
rendered), pass `--source-node-id <note_id>` — see the project `PROJECT_AGENT.md` §
"Asset, ref, and edge rules". Don't set `--shot-id` unless the user asked for a
specific reel position; the Timeline UI owns shot_id assignment.

Each clip costs real money even after staging — only stage after the user has explicitly asked for a video.

## Reference caps (video-generation)

≤9 image refs, ≤3 audio refs, ≤3 video refs. Each audio / video ref must be **1.8s–15.2s per file**. **Video refs additionally cap at 15s aggregate** (sum across the ≤3 video refs); audio has no aggregate cap. Audio refs need an image or video anchor — they can't be the only reference. Don't preflight — submit and read `limits` + `sent` on failure. Audio / video duration is on canvas — read `audio_result.data.metadata.duration_sec` and `video_result.data.duration` from `workflow.json`. Never ffprobe canvas-local files (and ffprobe may not be installed).

## Reference roles — vocabulary

The same CLI flag can serve different semantic roles depending on how the prompt names the ref. Choose the role first; the prompt phrasing binds it.

| Role | Flag | Wording in prompt |
|---|---|---|
| Character identity | `--ref-source-id` (image) | "the character in @Image1" |
| Location / setting | `--ref-source-id` (image) | "the location shown in @Image1" |
| Opening frame | `--ref-source-id` (image) | "opening frame @Image1, …" |
| Closing frame | `--ref-source-id` (image) | "closing on the frame from @Image1" |
| Source clip — continue | `--ref-source-id` (video) | "Continue from @Video1 — start after its final frame, no frames from @Video1 in the new clip" |
| Source clip — transform | `--ref-source-id` (video) | "Re-render @Video1 in …" |
| Camera-move source | `--ref-source-id` (video) | "camera moves match @Video1" |
| Action source | `--ref-source-id` (video) | "action choreography matches @Video1" |
| VFX template | `--ref-source-id` (video) | "use the visual-effects template from @Video1" |
| Spoken audio / voice | `--ref-audio-source-id` | "spoken audio from @Audio1" |

## Prompt-language conventions

- Reference syntax: `@Image1` / `@Video1` / `@Audio1`, positional, in `--ref-source-id` / `--ref-audio-source-id` order (image and video refs share the `@Image…` / `@Video…` slot per their source node type).
- Camera language is **rules, not adjectives** — *"one-take"*, *"steady follow shot"*, *"Iaijutsu draw"* not *"cinematic"*, *"fast"*, *"high-quality"*.
- Avoid conflicting instructions ("static camera" + "orbit shot").
- For brand / MV / ad work, end the prompt with a negative line: *"no captions, watermarks, distortion, stretching."*
- For polish on a single-shot clip: see [`references/video-single-shot.md`](references/video-single-shot.md).

## Patterns

Pick the one that fits. For source lookup, follow the project `PROJECT_AGENT.md` § "Choosing context"; this skill only owns video-specific prompt and CLI shape.

### 1. Standalone T2V

**Triggers:** a fresh clip unrelated to canvas content ("a noir alley at dawn, slow dolly-in", "a runner in a stadium, 10 seconds").
**Call:** `node "$PAI_REPO_ROOT/server/cli/generate_video.js" --prompt "..."` with sensible defaults (15s, 16:9, 1080p, audio on).
**Edges:** none.
**For the bracket scaffold and slot-by-slot construction when the user wants polish:** see [`references/video-single-shot.md`](references/video-single-shot.md).

### 2. Animate a canvas image (I2V)

**Triggers:** "animate this", "make a video of this image", "put motion on this still" — applied to a specific canvas `image_result` (character, location, or otherwise).
**Source:** the named `image_result` node — just `id`.
**Call:** `node "$PAI_REPO_ROOT/server/cli/generate_video.js" --prompt "..." --ref-source-id <image.id>`.
**Edges:** `{ from: <source.id>, to: video_<N>, kind: "derived" }` — emitted by the CLI.
**Anchor sub-variants:** opening-frame (default — *"opening frame @Image1, …"*) and closing-frame (*"closing on the frame from @Image1"*) — both pass the image as `--ref-source-id`; the anchor direction lives in the prompt wording, since the upstream model exposes no separate last-frame param.
**For slot-by-slot construction and the opening- vs closing-frame phrasing:** see [`references/video-single-shot.md`](references/video-single-shot.md).

### 3. Compose with canvas characters / locations

**Triggers:** "a video of [character]", "put [character] in [setting]", "[character] does [action]" — when at least one canvas character or location is involved.
**Source:** character / location `image_result` nodes (cap from §Reference caps).
**Call:** `node "$PAI_REPO_ROOT/server/cli/generate_video.js" --prompt "..." --ref-source-id <char1.id> --ref-source-id <char2.id> ...`.
**Edges:** `{ from: <char.id>, to: video_<N>, kind: "derived" }` — one per `--ref-source-id`.
**For single-shot composition and adjacent-role wording:** see [`references/video-single-shot.md`](references/video-single-shot.md). **For ≥2 internal shots in one render:** see [`references/video-multi-shot.md`](references/video-multi-shot.md).

### 4. Extend a canvas clip

**Triggers:** "continue from this", "extend this clip by Ns", "what happens after", "scene 2 follows scene 1" — applied to an existing canvas `video_result`.
**Source:** any canvas `video_result` node — agent-generated *or* user-uploaded (`data.metadata.source` is `"pai"` for generated and `"user_upload"` for dropped).
**Call:** `node "$PAI_REPO_ROOT/server/cli/generate_video.js" --prompt "..." --ref-source-id <source_video.id>`.
**Edges:** `{ from: <source_video.id>, to: video_<N>, kind: "derived" }`.
**For the continuity prefix, sub-intent decision tree, and sequencing across multiple linked calls:** see [`references/video-extension.md`](references/video-extension.md).

### 5. Edit a canvas clip

**Triggers:** "re-render in golden hour", "restyle as anime", "add rain", "remove the passerby", "swap the product", "change the wardrobe color", "rewrite what happens" — applied to an existing canvas `video_result`. Creative edits go through `generate_video.js`, not local `ffmpeg` (which is reserved for mechanical ops).
**Source:** any canvas `video_result` node — agent-generated *or* user-uploaded.
**Call:** `node "$PAI_REPO_ROOT/server/cli/generate_video.js" --prompt "..." --ref-source-id <source_video.id>`.
**Edges:** `{ from: <source_video.id>, to: video_<N>, kind: "derived" }`.
**For the Restyle / Partial / Replace / Re-plot decision tree and per-mode templates:** see [`references/video-editing.md`](references/video-editing.md).

### 6. Voice-driven clip

**Triggers:** "have [character] say this", "make a video where [character] says / narrates …", "use [character]'s voice in this clip".
**Source:** any canvas `audio_result` node — agent-generated or user-uploaded.
**Call:** `node "$PAI_REPO_ROOT/server/cli/generate_video.js" --prompt "..." --ref-audio-source-id <audio_id>`. Often combined with character image refs for face + voice — pass both `--ref-source-id <character_id>` (for the character image) and `--ref-audio-source-id <audio_id>` (for the voice).
**Prompt — inline this iteration:**
- If the audio node already contains speech (`audio_result.data.text`), do not duplicate, rewrite, or paraphrase those words in the video prompt. The audio node is the speech source of truth.
- For off-screen narration: *"Use narration timing and cadence from @Audio1. Visuals should pace to the narration. Do not render captions or on-screen transcript text."*
- For on-screen dialogue with a character image: *"The character in @Image1 performs to the spoken audio from @Audio1. Keep the spoken words from @Audio1 unchanged."*
- If there is no audio node yet and the user wants the video model to generate speech directly, then preserve the requested dialogue verbatim in the prompt as `[Character] says: "..."`; prefer routing to `voice-compose` first when exact VO/dialogue matters.
- Never treat an image as the speech source; images can identify the speaker, but the spoken words come from the audio node or the user-provided dialogue.

**Edges:** depends on which character refs attach (one `kind: "derived"` per ref).

### 7. Multi-shot / brand / ad / MV

**Triggers:** ≥2 distinct shots inside one render, ad / music-video / brand framing, durations ≥10s with multiple movements.
**Call:** `node "$PAI_REPO_ROOT/server/cli/generate_video.js" --prompt "..." [--ref-source-id <image|video.id> ...] [--ref-audio-source-id <audio.id> ...]`.
**Edges:** as per the underlying pattern (3, 4, 5) for any refs attached.
**For the 4-section scaffold (timeline / effects inventory / density map / energy arc) and how to populate the timeline from canvas script shot notes or storyboard mosaic panels:** see [`references/video-multi-shot.md`](references/video-multi-shot.md).

## Common combinations

Cross-pattern asks. Each combo routes to one primary reference — references don't link to each other.

| Combo | Primary reference | Extra refs to attach |
|---|---|---|
| Character + voice-over | (Pattern 6 inline) | character image |
| Music video with characters | `video-multi-shot.md` | character images + audio (Pattern 6 wording) |
| Restyle preserving identity | `video-editing.md` (Restyle) | source video + character image |
| Multi-clip chained sequence | `video-extension.md` | source video for each link |
| Compose with camera-move from reference | `video-single-shot.md` | character images + camera-move video ref |
| Render one script shot from canvas | Pattern 1, 2, or 3 by shot content (no dispatch — translate the shot note body to slot rules) | character / location refs if the shot involves them |
| Render a continuous script span (>15s total) as a dependent sequence | `video-extension.md` (script-driven chain) | source video only for dependent links; character refs for identity continuity |
| Render a short script (≤15s total) as one piece | `video-multi-shot.md` (cross-skill source) | character image refs locked across shots |
| Render a storyboard mosaic as one 15s video (every panel becomes a shot block) | `video-multi-shot.md` (storyboard cross-skill source) | mosaic image + character / location image refs that authored the mosaic |

## After the CLI returns

For draft-stage JSON, one sentence with the price/status — see the project `PROJECT_AGENT.md` § "Draft gate". For terminal results, follow the project manual's next-step recommendation rule. `--ref-source-id` flags drive provenance edges; they're captured in the draft argv and materialize on the real `video_result` after the user fires.

## On failure

Shape and class taxonomy: see the project `PROJECT_AGENT.md` § "Failure handling". Video-specific:

- `asset_rejected` with *"DownloadFailed"* — `failed_url` was unreachable; swap.
- `asset_rejected` with *"DurationTooLong"* / *"DurationTooShort"* — `failed_url`'s duration is outside 1.8s–15.2s. Swap it or trim with ffmpeg.
- `bad_args` with *"reference_audio cannot be the only reference input"* — add an image or video ref alongside the audio.
- `generation_failed` with *"invalid video duration, exceeds 15s"* — sum of `sent.video_urls` durations breached `limits.max_total_video_sec`. Read each video_result's `data.duration` from canvas (or ffprobe external URLs) and drop refs until the sum is ≤15s.
- `generation_failed` (other) — upstream non-policy failure. Paraphrase and ask.

**Never auto-retry.** Each call is real money.
